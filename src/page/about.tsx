                <p>                
                    I am a developer from New Zealand who began his journey during the COVID pandemic. With so much time on my hands, it made sense at the time to challenge myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I found was a never-ending hill. Everytime I pulled myself forward, I find new heights to conquer. Every project I work on, I find new things that I've never considered before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was enamored with the challenge and growing up an internet kid that drew a lot, it was almost predetermined that I would fall into the path of front-end development.
