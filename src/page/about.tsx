                I am a developer from New Zealand who began his journey during the COVID pandemic. With so much time on my hands, it made sense at the time to challenge myself.
                <br/><br/>
                What I found was a never-ending hill. Everytime I pulled myself forward, I find new heights to conquer. Every project I work on, I find new things that I've never considered before.
                <br/><br/>
                I was enamored with the challenge and growing up an internet kid that drew a lot, it was almost predetermined that I would fall into the path of front-end development.
                <br/><br/>
                Am I competent yet? Maybe. Is there a lot more to learn? Absolutely. And the only way forward is one step at a time.
                <br/><br/>
                Lived another life studying and working in the field of Legal Studies and Taxation. I have been admitted to the bar in NZ.
